This repository contains a text file named tinyData. It contains all the comments which would help you to understand what and how the functions work.
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1. Download the dataset and load the activity as well as the feature information.
2. Load both the datasets (test and training ones). Keep only those columns that reflect a mean or standard deviation value.
3. Load the activity and subject data for each dataset. Later merge the columns.
4. Merge both of the datasets.
5. The activity has to be converted. And the columns are subjected into factors.
6. A dataset tiny consists of the mean values of all the varaibles present for each pair and subject.

The end result is shown in the file tinyData.txt.
